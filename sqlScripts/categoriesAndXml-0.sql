Beautifully engraved certificate from the Hertz Corporation issued in 1976-1977. This historic document was printed by the Security-Columbian Banknote Company and has an ornate border around it with a vignette of an allegorical man and woman sitting beside the company\'s logo. This item has the printed signatures of the company_s chairman (Robert L. Stone) and vice-president,finance and assistant secretary. This bond is over 34 years old. Hertz, the world\'s leading vehicle renting organization, is represented in over 140 countries, operating a fleet of 525,000 vehicles from approximately 6,500 locations. The pioneer of auto renting was Walter L. Jacobs who in September of 1918, at the age of 22, opened a car-rental operation in Chicago. Starting with a dozen Model T Fords, which he repaired and repainted himself, Jacobs expanded his operation to the point where, within five years, the business generated annual revenues of about $1 million. In 1923, Jacobs sold his car-rental concern to John Hertz, President of Yellow Cab and Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. Jacobs continued as Hertz\' top operating and administrative executive. This rental business, called Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System, was acquired in 1926 by General Motors Corporation when it bought Yellow Truck from John Hertz. The Hertz Corporation In 1953, the Hertz properties were bought from GMC by the Omnibus Corporation, which divested itself of its bus interest and concentrated solely on car and truck renting and leasing. A year later, a new name was taken -- The Hertz Corporation -- and it was listed for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. Jacobs became Hertz\' first President and served in that post until his retirement in 1960. He died in 1985 at the age of 88. In 1954, the new corporation bought Metropolitan Distributors, a pioneer in New York truck leasing dating back to World War I and the largest concern of its kind in any one city. In the process, the head of Metropolitan, Leon C. Greenbaum, became Vice Chairman of the Hertz Board of Directors; he later became Chairman, and in 1960, Chief Executive Officer. In 1967, The Hertz Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA Corporation and operated as a separate entity, with its own management and Board of Directors. In 1985, Hertz joined UAL, Inc. On December 30, 1987, Hertz was sold to Park Ridge Corporation, a company formed by Ford Motor Company and Hertz management, for the purpose of purchasing Hertz. In 1988, Volvo North America Corporation joined Ford and Hertz management as an investor in Park Ridge Corporation. In 1993, Park Ridge Corporation was merged into The Hertz Corporation. In 1994, Ford purchased the outstanding shares of Hertz and Hertz became an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of The Ford Motor Company. On April 25, 1997, Hertz became a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol \"HRZ.\" Hertz Today Hertz is headquartered in Park Ridge, New Jersey. Its current headquarters location opened in 1988. Prior to that the corporation was based in New York and, before that, Chicago. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is the site of Hertz\' Worldwide Reservations Center and Data Center, established in 1970, and its Financial Center, established in 1994. Car rentals, the largest and best known of Hertz\' activities, are conducted from more than 1,600 domestic, corporate and licensee locations, and approximately 4,500 corporate and licensee locations outside the United States. Hertz offers a wide variety of current-model cars on a short-term rental basis -- daily, weekly or monthly -- at airports, in downtown and suburban business centers, and in residential areas and resort locales. Today, Hertz\' Worldwide Reservations System handles approximately 40 million phone calls and delivers in total approximately 30 million reservations annually This Authentic certificate looks great framed and is much nicer in person than the scan indicates.

We thank all of you who have taken the time to view, bid on and win our auctions! As always, we\'re happy to answer your questions about hosiery or any of our items. You can pay for this auction with: Money Order, Personal Check (will send you the item when it clears), With Your Visa Or MasterCard in the U.S. You Can Use PayPal. PayPal is now available around the world. Click on the PayPal logo below or visit them at: http://www.paypal.com, or, If You\'re An International Bidder, You Can Use Bid Pay To Send A Western Union Money Order In U.S. DOLLARS! They are at http://www.bidpay.com And now a quick word about our rules of the road. Please Take 2 Minutes To Read This And Avoid Delays Or Misunderstandings: 1.) Please Pay For Your Item Within 5 Days. If You\'re Having An Emergency Or A Problem, Let Us Know, We\'ll Work With You. Items not paid for in the specified time may be withheld from the non-paying bidder and may relisted. 2.) Non-paying Bidders Will Receive A Non-Paying Bidders Notice To eBay And Face Negative Feedback, And Ultimately Termination Of Their eBay Account If They Make A Habit Of Not Paying For Auctions. 3.) All Sales Final Unless Otherwise Marked So Please Ask Any Questions Before You Bid. 4.) If You Win More Than One Item Within 24 Hours, Please Be Sure To Let Us Know, So You Can Enjoy Combined Shipping And Save Money 5.) Please Include A Copy Of The Notification Letter With Your Payment For Fastest Service, Whether You Pay By PayPal Or Snail Mail. If You Don\'t Please Be Sure To Include The eBay Auction Number For Each Item, As Well As A Small Description Of Your Item(s) For The Fastest Service! 6.) Unlike A Majority Of Dealers On eBay We Leave You Feedback A.S.A.P. After Receiving Your Payment. We Would Appreciate Positive Feedback From You If You\'re Happy With Your Item When You Receive It. 7.) All Money Order or Check Payments MUST be drawn on a U.S. Bank, in U.S. Dollars. For example: A Money Order From The Royal Canadian Bank in U.S. Dollars is NOT accepted, not because we don\'t like Canadians, but because our bank imposes a hefty fee for such money orders. Canadian and European customers are encouraged to use PayPal or Bid Pay for payments. 8.) If you pay with PayPal and you have won multiple items, PLEASE make only 1 PayPal Payment and include all the auction numbers on the one payment. It simplifies it for you and for me. Also, PayPal charges a transaction fee for EACH payment made, in addition to their OTHER fees to the seller. We combine shipping to save you money - please combine multiple auction PayPal payments into ONE to help keep our costs low, so we can KEEP providing Lower Cost combined shipping.... A quick check of our feedback will show you that nearly every other buyer buys from us more than once!! Also, a larger percentage of our feedback centers on our FAST SHIPPING!!! Are you tired of paying for an item and waiting for 2 weeks? Not with Kathy\'s Nostalgiabilia. We get your money on Monday, and your item goes out by Wednesday or sooner if possible!! Our shipping rates are still among the best on eBay, even with the recent rise in rates in the Post Office. For up to 4 pairs of stockings: In the U.S $2.50; Canada: $2.75; Europe: $3.75. If you win other than hosiery items, Please See Listing For Actual Shipping Rate, or buyer is responsible for reasonable shipping rate. Believe me, ours are among the best shipping rates on eBay!! Our feedback profile is proof we deliver, however, we are not responsible for loss of goods in the mail that are not insured. Insurance is extra and based on total. Insured items go out once a week: Monday. Non-insured items go out a.s.a.p. upon receipt of payment. Kathy\'s Nostalgia Guarantees Every Item To Be As Described Or Your Money Back!

Plate number 4944A is the fourth of this series. This sculpture plate captures a 3-D image of merry little angles singing & playing musical instruments in this special Christmas collection. Not only is each plate in lifelike three-dimension, but each contains a music box that plays the beloved Christmas carol featured at the turn of a key. The detail is superb, and each plate has bright cheerful holiday colors. The texture and proportions of each object are perfectly captured from the original sculpture. This 5 plate series of charming hand-crafted art recalls the joys of Christmas. The plate is approximately 6 inches in diameter, is in mint condition, has never been displayed, and comes in the original packaging with certificate of authenticity. Each plate has a clasp on the back of the plate so that it can be hung on the wall and a small built in base so it can stand upright on its own. The plates originally sold for $44 directly from Bradford Exchange. This plate will make a great Christmas gift. I HAVE ALL FIVE PLATES FROM THIS SERIES AND WILL LIST THEM ALL. Winning bid can pay by BillPoint, PayPal, money order, or check. Please allow 5 days for personal checks to clear before I ship the item. PLEASE SUBMIT PAYMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER AUCTION HAS CLOSED. I pack the items carefully; however, I cannot be held responsible for lost or broken items. Buyer can purchase insurance for an extra $1.10 to $3.00 depending on the value of the shipment. Shipping is by Priority Mail. The plates are easily twice to three times the weight of a typical Bradford Exchange plate so shipping 1 plate is $6.45; 2 plates are $8.35 and 3 plates are $10.00. I try to give an accurate description of the condition so you know what you are purchasing. Please feel free to E-mail me prior to bidding if you have any questions. Will do my best to get the plates out as fast as possible, but shipping during the holidays can be slow. Thank you for looking.

Developed by the man who has had more influence than almost anyone else in magic on the Torn and Restored Card theme, J. C. Wagner, this is a practical and magical rendition of a classic card routine. Both the effect and the method are simple and direct! A card is selected and SIGNED along one edge. The card is then creased and torn into four VERY distinct pieces. Two of the pieces are put aside and the two remaining are visually and magically restored into one piece!! One of the remaining two pieces in now VISUALLY restored to the first two. The restorations are clean and beautiful to watch. With the last piece you get to see a J.C. presentation \"Master Stroke\" and why his creations are always tuned to the audience!! The last piece is placed with the first three and then handed to the spectator. The spectator holds the pieces for a moment and then opens the pieces to find a TOTALLY RESTORED SIGNED CARD !!

Shipping must be postmarked within 4 days after we have accepted the request. Return only upon item not being as described or damaged in transit. We insure all items through shipper so paperwork must be completed with help of buyer before refund for damage. Please contact us first. Please read all stipulations below, if you cannot honor or abide by them, do not waste our time or yours. We do not enjoy giving negatives or receiving threatening mail about an impending negative or non paying bidder process, but to be fair we have guidelines that we follow and make perfectly clear in our auctions. I really regret having to implement these stipulations in our auctions, but irresponsible bidders and timewasters have made it necessary. Those buyers who do not seem to understand that we do not take checks also have made this necessary. For those of you who are responsible bidders, who read the entire auction before they bid, please know that this is not aimed at you and that we welcome you and your purchase. I have met a lot of really nice courteous bidders and sellers here and hope to keep meeting you all in the future. For you repeat buyers, thank you for your trust in me and I really do value your business. 1. we use a set shipping and insurance fee . This fee will take in oversize boxes if this pertains to the auction, and delivery confirmation and insurance on all items. It does also include a handling fee in the amount which will take care of our expenses in getting the item to you safe and sound, extra insurance and sales tax. We try very hard to be as close to the shipping and insurance as we can,but still allow extra for the above. Shipping will be on the Saturday after payment is recieved. Shipping will be by Priority mail insurance , delivery confirmation and handling fee will mean a total shipping price of 6.50 for this item. non US bidders will need to pay more. Please contact us to make sure that we mail to your country before you bid and to check out the shipping and insurance costs. There are some countries that do not allow insurance and therefore we are not able to send to this country. 2. . I do reserve the right to not accept bids from those with negative feed-back ; history of non payment; late payments; lack of communications or unreasonable demands or retractions. If you snipe at the last minute, we will hold to these same standards and may not honor your bid for the same reasons. All bidders are held to the same standards to be fair. Regardless of feedback or buyer/seller status. 3. Payment is fine money order or cashier check. We are no longer taking checks. If you send a check, it will NOT be considered payment and will either be destroyed or returned with your merchandise upon proper payment. We also take paypal payments from verified accounts which unfortunately does not include other countries at present. You would send to momahedger@aol.com. 4. We do participate in the NPB process. 5. I leave feedback when I know that the buyer has recieved their item. I do not need for the buyer to leave it first, but I do need to know that the item has arrived. I rate my buyers on their payment, on their communication with us during and after the auction and their reading and following our guidelines in the auction. Many sellers do it different. As soon as I know that the item has arrived I will go and leave feedback .

I belive the books and the free market speak for themselves (IN MOST CASES), so why thrust a imaginary support level on the auction? The cgc census report is now avalable on their web site, cgccomics.com (as of 7-12-01). I strongly encourage all serious bidders to visit this site, especially when bidding on more expensive or scarce books. Many of the books I offer up on ebay and on my website are of the highest slabbed grades at present, or in a good number of times-the ONLY book of it\'s kind to have been graded. This information is powerful when buying, selling or bidding. I am a CGC Charter member, and AACC member. My grading is guaranteed,-refering to unslabbed books, naturally- I have been a collector and seller/dealer for over 35 years. Many references available, if you need them. If not satisfied I will return a full refund for the books, as long as they are returned in original condition. All items packed securely. Shipping is $6 in the Cont.USA. Insurance is extra-$2 and up-(for merchadise $100 or more) depending on price of book, and I will not be responsible for uninsured books(anything over $100). I usually ship ONCE a week depending on volume, (sometimes more), using either USPS-priority mail, OR Fed Ex ground, either takes 2-4 days. All CGC books are non returnable, I will warrenty against any cracks in the slab, though. Most (USPS) books sent by certified. Overseas postage is at LEAST $15 per package, so please keep this in mind if you are bidding from overseas, or just please refrain from bidding. Also, most bidders are honorable, but do not bid if you are unsure that you can make payment and agree to terms. For USA orders, you may combine up to 5 CGC books and up to 12 non CGC books per order. Thanks for looking, have fun, and please visit my web site and other auctions.
